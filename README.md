# Time to Go

A Go/Igo/Weiqi/Baduk-inspired watchface for the Pebble Time that plays through the famous Game of the Century in 1934 (Honinbo Shusai vs. Go Seigen), which lasted over three months.

On this watchface, the game lasts 24 hours with the game progressing roughly every half an hour (by 6 moves).
